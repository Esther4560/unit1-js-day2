/* EXERCISE 1
 Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain the concepts as you were speaking to a 12 years old.
*/

/* Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.
There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: 
primitive (or primary), composite (or reference), and special data types. String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. 
Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. 
Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types. 

The String Data Type

The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). 
Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters.
example 
var a = 'Hi there!';  // using single quotes
var b = "Hi there!";  // using double quotes

The Number Data Type
The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, 
or numbers written using exponential notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10-4).
example
var a = 25;         // integer
var b = 80.5;       // floating-point number
var c = 4.25e+6;    // exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 4250000
var d = 4.25e-6;    // exponential notation, same as 0.00000425 

The Boolean Data Type
The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. 
It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. 
as demonstrated below:
var isReading = true;   // yes, I'm reading
var isSleeping = false; // no, I'm not sleeping
Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons in a program.
The following example compares two variables and shows the result in an alert dialog box:
var isReading = true;   // yes, I'm reading
var isSleeping = false; // no, I'm not sleeping*/

/* EXERCISE 2

/* EXERCISE 3
 Write the code to execute an addition (a sum) of the numbers 12 and 20.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 4
 Create a variable named x and assign to it the number 12.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 5
 Create a variable called name and assign to it the string "John Doe".
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 6
 Execute a subtraction between the number 12 and the variable x you declared before (which is storing the value 12).
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 7
 Create two variables: name1 and name2. Assign to name1 the string "john", and to name2 the string "John" (this one has a capital J!)
 Verify that name1 is different from name2 (HINT: check their equality to be false).
 Finally, verify that the equality between name1 and name2 becomes true if both are lowercase (without changing the value of name2).

/* EXERCISE 8
 Create a variable named x, and assign to it a numeric value less than 10.
 Write the code to print the literal value of x (ex.: if x is 1, it should print "one", if x is 5 it should print "five" etc.).

/* EXERCISE 9
 [Extra] Assign a value to a variable using a ternary operator (this topic has not been covered during lesson yet,
 try to search it by yourself, tomorrow morning we'll discuss it together!)
